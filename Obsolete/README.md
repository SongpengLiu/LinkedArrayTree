Files in this folder are obsoleted.

Code of these data strctures, including the traditional search algorithms red-black tree, google B+-tree, and some new data structures are obsoleted.

The new data structures are used to attempt to meet diverse usage scenarios during inventing the new search algorithm. But for the sake of clear and concise, I only introduced LRT in the paper. Code in this folder should be only for study.

You should updated and optimized them if you want to use them.
